This repository will contains matlab based programs linked to the following publication: 'Multiplexed biochemical imaging reveals caspase activation patterns underlying single cell fate', curently published on Bioarchive. Currently this repository is empty and will be updataed towards the end of October 2018.
Bispoken programs can be used to analyse the biochemical multiplexing data obtained with up to 3 different FRET-based biosensors. Shortly, it contains the features like: phasor-based spectral unmixing and data representation; methods to calculate enzymatic activities from cleavage based FRET biosensors.
