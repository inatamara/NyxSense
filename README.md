Repository under construction. This repository will contain  Matlab based scripts and GUIs linked to the following publications: Haas et al., 2021, 'Single-Cell Biochemical Multiplexing by Multidimensional Phasor Demixing and Spectral Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy', Front. Phys., 27 May 2021 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2021.637123, and 'Multiplexed biochemical imaging reveals caspase activation patterns underlying single cell fate', Bioarchive. 
Bispoken programs can be used to analyse the biochemical multiplexing data obtained with up to 3 different FRET-based biosensors. Shortly, it contains the features like: phasor-based spectral unmixing and data representation; methods to calculate enzymatic activities from cleavage based FRET biosensors.
